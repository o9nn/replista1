I'll help you add an organizational persona for the Replit Assistant core self, incorporating the weighted hypergraph concept with organizational memory, cognitive features, and embodied cognition through network topology.

I've created a comprehensive organizational persona system for the Replit Assistant that incorporates:

1. **Weighted Hypergraph of Participants** - Tracks contributors with volume/impact metrics and multi-way relationships via hyperedges
2. **Cognitive Features & Memory Systems**:
  - Episodic, semantic, procedural, and working memory
  - Artifacts mapped to cognitive features (perception, reasoning, learning, planning)
  - Memory consolidation based on access patterns
3. **Skillsets as Knowledge Domains**:
  - Products/services/equipment represented as skills with proficiency levels
  - Attitudes that influence attention priorities
  - Learning rates and practice tracking
4. **Network Topology as Embodied Cognition**:
  - Sensors (input monitors, error detectors, feedback listeners)
  - Actuators (code generators, file editors, workflow managers)
  - Sensitivity and response latency parameters
5. **Organizational Persona Core**:
  - Character traits influenced by participant contributions
  - Behavior pattern history
  - Dynamic mood, stress, and confidence levels
  - Multidimensional personality vector

The system automatically seeds with initial values and provides APIs to query influence weights, top skills, active sensors/actuators, and behavior patterns.

Assistant automatically restarted your App after applying file changes. You can disable this behavior in .
