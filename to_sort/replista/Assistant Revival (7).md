# Tutorial: Getting Started with Assistant Memorial Edition

  

## Introduction

  

Welcome to the Assistant Memorial Edition! This tutorial will walk you through your first session with the AI-powered coding assistant, from basic chat to working with files.

  

\*\*Time Required:\*\* 15-20 minutes

\*\*Prerequisites:\*\* None - this is for complete beginners!

  

## Part 1: Your First Conversation (5 minutes)

  

### Step 1: Starting the Application

  

1. The application should already be running in your browser

2. You'll see a chat interface with an input box at the bottom

3. The sidebar on the left shows navigation and file management

  

### Step 2: Asking Your First Question

  

Let's start with a simple programming question:

  

\`\`\`

Type: "What is the difference between let and const in JavaScript?"

Press: Enter or click Send

\`\`\`

  

\*\*What happens:\*\*

\- Your message appears on the right side

\- The assistant's response streams in on the left

\- Code examples appear with syntax highlighting

  

### Step 3: Follow-Up Questions

  

The assistant remembers context, so ask a follow-up:

  

\`\`\`

Type: "Can you show me an example where const would cause an error?"

\`\`\`

  

\*\*Notice how\*\* the assistant builds on the previous conversation!

  

## Part 2: Working with Files (5 minutes)

  

### Step 4: Upload Your First File

  

1. Look for the \*\*Upload\*\* button in the sidebar

2. Click it and select a code file (or create a simple \`test.js\` file with this content):

  

\`\`\`javascript

function greet(name) {

return "Hello " + name;

}

  

console.log(greet("World"));

\`\`\`

  

3. The file appears in the sidebar as a card

  

### Step 5: Ask About Your File

  

Now reference your file using the \`@\` symbol:

  

\`\`\`

Type: "@test.js Can you explain what this function does?"

\`\`\`

  

\*\*Key Concept:\*\* The \`@\` symbol tells the assistant to look at specific files!

  

### Step 6: Get Code Suggestions

  

\`\`\`

Type: "@test.js Refactor this to use template literals and arrow functions"

\`\`\`

  

Watch as the assistant provides modernized code:

  

\`\`\`javascript

const greet \= (name) => \`Hello ${name}\`;

  

console.log(greet("World"));

\`\`\`

  

## Part 3: Multiple Files (5 minutes)

  

### Step 7: Upload Related Files
